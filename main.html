	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity
</h1>
	<p>Time complexity refers to the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the time it takes to execute as a function of the input size. Algorithms with lower time complexity are more efficient as they execute faster, especially for large inputs. Analyzing time complexity helps in understanding how an algorithm performs as the input size increases.</p>
<p>Space Complexity, on the other hand, refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses as a function of the input size. It is often denoted as O(n), where 'n' represents the size of the input. Understanding space complexity is crucial for optimizing memory usage and designing algorithms that are efficient in terms of memory utilization. <b>Space Complexity</b> analysis is particularly important in scenarios where memory resources are limited or need to be optimized.</p>
